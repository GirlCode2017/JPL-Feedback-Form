# JPL-Feedback-Form

A Feedback Form starter project.

## Feedback Form Practice

## I am a member of the Javascript Propulsion Learning (may likely be referred to as JPL in furture projects) group at work.

We were challenged to use our knowledge learned from the Javascript Essential Training course from LinkedIN Learning (found here: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training?u=2148713) to build a form that on submit takes text from user input and displays it on the page.

Addnitonally, a bonus challenge was to use Bootstrap in the project.

I furthered my learning on Regex and error handling to acheive some other functionality that you will see in the project.

Thank you for reading!
